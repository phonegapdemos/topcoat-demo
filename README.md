# PhoneGap + Topcoat Demo

Test mobile application built with PhoneGap and Topcoat framework.

## Includes

This demo contains or includes following things:

_This demo should present all key features of Topcoat framework, including all available widgets and page themes. Plus it should also contain examples of translation library for multi-language mobile apps and other libraries useful in modern mobile apps development like [meSpeak.js](http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/) and others._

## About framework

Ugly, but promised to be very fast, as it is pure CSS-based framework with JS limited to minimum. You don't get many widgets, but you do get super fast UI. Supports Zepto. Rather one-page-apps oriented. There are examples of mobile applications built with this framework, ready out-of-the-box as GitHub repositories, which can be an advantage for some and which can possibly speed up development of own mobile app with this framework.

## Important notices

This project can be tested directly in browser with using [Ripple Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ripple-emulator-beta/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc?hl=en). However, project itself is written using [newest PhoneGap API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en), while Ripple Emulator has very old [2.0.0 API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.0.0/index.html) behind. Thus, _some parts of this demo will not work in desktop computer browser_. You have to compile it and test it on mobile device, if you want to see all implemented things in action.
